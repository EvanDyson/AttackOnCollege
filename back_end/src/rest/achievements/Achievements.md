# Achievements

THis file contains information about all the possible achievements any user could collect. They are all listed here along with the number of experience points that a student can get for collecting it.

## Rest files explained

The rest files in this directory are all requests for modifying achievements. In the future, these could potentially be edited so an authorized user could add the achievements without having to deal with the back end of the site. This would allow for different roles in maintaining the app outside of development. 

Each rest file, for now, contains a template for achievement modification. CreateAchievement.rest creates a new achievement, EditAchievement.rest modifies the fields in the achievement, and DeleteAchievement.rest deletes it.
