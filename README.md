## Developed by Pierce Casey, Evan Dyson, Michael Hoctor, Sara Osmanovic

*Working on the front end will be Evan Dyson and Michael Hoctor.*

## Documentation of the requirements for running and using our app.

### Front-End
Our front-end is based off of angular. 
In order to properly run angular applications it is recommended by the developers to have Node.js installed, as well as having the angular CLI downloaded locally.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* After downloading Node.js ``` npm install -g @angular/cli ```

After downloading both required things and downloading our project AttackonCollege, enter the project folder and run the following commands in console.

* ``` npm install ```
* ``` ng install ```
* ``` ng serve ```

You can then navigate to [localhost:4200](localhost:4200)

**Please note that this will only launch the front end unconnected to the backend**


### Back-end
