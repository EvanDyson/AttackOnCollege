# Welcome to Attack on College, our CEN3031 project

## Developed by Pierce Casey, Evan Dyson, Michael Hoctor, Sara Osmanovic

*Working on the front end will be Evan Dyson and Michael Hoctor.*

*Working on the back end will be Pierce Casey and Sara Osmanovic.*

Our goal is to create software to improve the experience and motivation of college students. Our website will allow students to create a profile, and input specifics about their college. 

The website will track achievements that users decide they want to work towards in their education.

Our ambition is to feature some form of local leaderboard showing off recent achievements earned by users, inspiring competition among peers.
